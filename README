# python-labs

This repository holds python labs taken from a python course at kth.se
The top Engineering institute in Scandinavia.

The labs are all dependent on each other, so lab2 depends on lab1 and so on.

## Requirements

Each folder has its own readme that contains all the requirements.
So each project has its own requirement (readme).
- Some projects you will have to fix the code in the original module.
- Others you will have to run and input the expected input (read the source code).
- And some you will have to create your own module, so you read the example files/modules and you can use them to create your own modules.


> *Make sure you read the links provided in the readme of each project as they cover the needed materials.*

## Future Improvements

We will have more labs and projects in the future, and will cover a wider range of concepts and ideas about python.
