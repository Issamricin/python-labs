# Lab one and two

## Lab 1

Write a function that calculates the sum of an arithmetic sequence (given return) and a function that calculates the sum of a geometric sequence (given return). Write a program that uses the functions. (Verify that the functions produce correct results.)

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between two elements is constant. For example 1,2,3,4,5

In a geometric sequence, it is instead the quotient (the result of division) between the elements that is constant. For example 1,2,4,8,16
is a geometric sequence where the quotient (the result of division) is two.

### Example

The arithmetic sum is: 11
The geometric sum is: 26

### Printout Sample

Enter the starting value (a1): 1
Enter the difference (d): 2
Enter the number of elements in the sequence (n): 3
The arithmetic sum is: 9

Enter the starting value (g1): 2
Enter the quotient (q): 2
Enter the number of elements in the sequence (n): 4
The geometric sum is: 30

### Requirements

The two sum functions should return the sum, which should then be printed from the main program.

## Lab 2

Let the user enter the values ​​for the variables. If the user enters the wrong type, the program should exit with an error message. 
After the sums are calculated, use the appropriate control structure to print as follows:

“The arithmetic sum is the largest” if the arithmetic sum is (strictly) greater than the geometric sum,

“The geometric sum is the largest” if the geometric sum is (strictly) greater,
or
“The sums are equal” if they are equal.

### Printout Sample

The user runs the program:
Arithmetic sum data:
Enter the starting value (a1): a

That was not a floating point number. Restart the program and try again.

The user runs the program again:
Arithmetic sum data:
Enter the starting value (a1): 1
Enter the difference (d): 2

Geometric sum data:
Enter the starting value (g1): 1.01
Enter the quotient (q): 1.10

Number of terms in the sums:
Enter the number of elements in the sequence (n): 10.1

That was not an integer. Restart the program and try again.

The user runs the program one more time:
Arithmetic sum data:
Enter the starting value (a1): 1
Enter the difference (d): 2

Geometric sum data:
Enter the starting value (g1): 1.01
Enter the quotient (q): 1.10

Number of terms in the sums:
Enter the number of elements in the sequence (n): 10
The arithmetic sum is the largest.

### Requirements

The arithmetic and geometric sum should use the same n.
All input should be error-handled.
Your program should be able to handle all test cases shown in the sample printout.
Your code should meet the requirements in the correction matrix.

### Printout Sample

Is the first sum [a]rhythmic or [g]eometric? a
Enter the starting value (a1): 1.02
Enter the difference (d): 0.1

Is the second sum [a]rhythmic or [g]eometric? g
Enter the starting value (g1): 1.02
Enter the quotient (q): 1.1

How many terms (n)? 10
The second sum is the largest.
