# The bomb game

We have put together a quiz. If you answer incorrectly, the bomb will detonate.

You need two files: the_bomb.py and bomb.py

Then run bomben.py:
 $ python3 the_bomb.py.

This is a small game where you have to avoid making the bomb explode

The user is given questions to answer. But since we like to detonate the bomb, 
We can also detonate it when the answer is correct. Therefore, the user must read the source code to 
avoid detonating the bomb.

so for example the code may be like:

ans = input("what is 5+5? ")
if ans == 10:
    bomb()

you can see that the program will explode if you answer 10 so you have to answer incorrectly to pass.

So how do you know how to answer? 

You read the code! as you play find where the program is at and then track it and avoid wrong answers.
