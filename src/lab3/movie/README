# Find five mistakes

Check out the movieticker.py module.
Read through the code and get a feel for what it is supposed to do. Try running the code.
Now find at least five errors/areas for improvement in the code together (think about what you have learned during the week).
Now improve the code based on what you have found. Did the code become more readable, useful and/or user-friendly? Why?
