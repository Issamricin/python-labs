# Doing things

We will now focus on writing functions that focus on breaking down algorithms into their component parts. This time the algorithms will be able to be a little more advanced, they will be able to do different things depending on different conditions.
We begin with an example
Check the module: walking.py which is in the same folder as this file.

Of course, we can break down the lift_leg function further. You can also see an interactive walkthrough of the code
Go to this link https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
Write down  the code above on paper and type it in the link to the execution visualization. You can use the link for any code you want to see how things get executed visually

## Requirements

Write a program that, in the same way as above, prints instructions for going to different places that the user can choose from.
Take a random walk (right, left, forward, backward) that is n meters long.
Dance (any dance) n beats, which steps should be taken with which feet at the different times in the music?
React if the user walks into a wall, falls down a hole, etc.

We will go through different solutions.
A useful building block for the walk and for adding some variety to the dance is randomization.
The following code illustrates how we can randomize numbers: random_generator.py

You can use the code from both files to create your own module.
(always run the example modules to see what they do. So run random_generator.py to see what it does and then implement it into your own module)
